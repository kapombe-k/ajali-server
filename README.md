- **Relationships**: One-to-many with Reports and EmergencyContacts

#### Reports Table
- **Primary Key**: id (Integer)
- **Fields**: user_id (FK), incident (type), details, latitude, longitude, timestamps
- **Relationships**: Belongs to User, has many MediaAttachments and StatusUpdates

#### MediaAttachments Table
- **Primary Key**: id (Integer)
- **Fields**: report_id (FK), file_url, media_type, uploaded_at
- **Features**: File storage with type validation (images/videos up to 5MB)

#### EmergencyContacts Table
- **Primary Key**: id (Integer)
- **Fields**: user_id (FK), name, relationship, phone_number, email, address
- **Purpose**: Quick access to user's emergency contacts

#### StatusUpdates Table
- **Primary Key**: id (Integer)
- **Fields**: report_id (FK), updated_by, status, timestamp
- **Purpose**: Track incident response progress

#### TokenBlocklist Table
- **Primary Key**: id (Integer)
- **Fields**: jti (JWT ID), created_at
- **Purpose**: JWT token revocation for secure logout

### API Architecture

The RESTful API follows RESTful conventions with the following endpoints:

#### Authentication Endpoints
